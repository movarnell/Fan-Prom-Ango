## Working on Issues 💻

Fan-Prom-Ango uses issues to track and manage tasks, bug fixes, and new features. If you'd like to work on a specific issue, please follow these steps:

### Each issue should have a branch already created for it, that is where you will do your work 🌿

To get to your issue's branch after cloning the project down: 

1. Access the Source Control Panel: In the left sidebar of Visual Studio Code, you'll find the Source Control icon. It looks like a square with a branch symbol or it may be labeled as "Git" if you're using Git for version control. Click on this icon to open the Source Control panel.

2. View Available Branches: In the Source Control panel, you'll see a list of available branches. If your desired branch already exists locally, you can simply click on it to switch to that branch. If it doesn't exist yet, you'll need to fetch it from the remote repository.

3. Fetch the Desired Branch: To fetch a branch that doesn't exist locally, click on the three dots (ellipsis) at the top of the Source Control panel, and then select "Pull, Fetch from...". Choose the remote repository where the branch resides (usually origin) and select the desired branch from the list. Click "OK" to fetch the branch.

4. Checkout the Branch: Once the branch is fetched, you can click on it in the Source Control panel to select it. You'll see an option to "Checkout" or "Switch to" the branch. Click this option, and Visual Studio Code will switch your workspace to the selected branch.

## What is a Pull Request (PR)? 🚀

A Pull Request (PR) is a fundamental concept in collaborative software development. It allows you to propose changes or additions to a project's codebase, documentation, or any other files. Pull Requests serve as a way to request that your modifications be reviewed and merged into the main project. They facilitate discussion, feedback, and collaboration among contributors.

## How to Create a Pull Request (PR) 🔄

#### After being made a contributor! 🎈

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using `git clone`. This will create a local copy of the project on your computer.

2. **Create a New Branch or checkout to issue branch**: Before making changes, create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive and relevant branch name, such as `feature/my-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-issue-123`. 🌿

    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-branch-name
    ```

4. **Make Your Changes**: Write your code, documentation, or any necessary updates. Commit your changes with meaningful commit messages. 📝

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Description of your changes"
    ```

5. **Push Your Code Up**: Push your branch up to the repository on GitHub. 🚀

6. **Create the Pull Request**: Go to the original project's repository on GitHub. You should see a notification that a branch was recently pushed. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button.

7. **Review and Submit**: Describe your changes in the pull request, referencing any related issues if applicable. Reviewers will examine your code, provide feedback, and discuss any necessary improvements. 📢

8. **Address Feedback**: If there are suggested changes, make them in your local branch, commit, and push again. The pull request will automatically update. 🛠️

9. **Merge the Pull Request**: Once your changes are approved, a project maintainer will merge your pull request into the main project. Congratulations! Your contributions are now part of the project. You are now officially an open-source contributor! 🎉

Pull Requests are essential for maintaining code quality and collaboration within open-source and team projects. They provide a structured way to propose, review, and merge code changes while allowing for discussion and feedback. 🤝
